# setState\(\) in componentWillMount\(\)

Avoid async initialization in `componentWillMount()`

`componentWillMount()` is invoked immediately before mounting occurs. It is called before `render()`, therefore setting state in this method will not trigger a re-render. Avoid introducing any side-effects or subscriptions in this method.

Make async calls for component initialization in `componentDidMount` instead of `componentWillMount`

```javascript
function componentDidMount() {
  axios.get(`api/messages`)
    .then((result) => {
      const messages = result.data
      console.log("COMPONENT WILL Mount messages : ", messages);
      this.setState({
        messages: [...messages.content]
      })
    })
}
```
